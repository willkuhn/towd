# Targeted Odonata Wing Digitization (TOWD) Project

## About

Dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) are highly skilled aerial acrobats, due largely to the intricacies of their most prominent features: their wings. The forewings and hindwings differ from species to species in their color patterns - some are clear while others have elements of bright coloration, banding, mottling, and iridescence - and in the arrangement of wing veins that govern their physical structure.

The TOWD Project is an [NSF-funded](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1564386&HistoricalAwards=false), multi-institutional effort initiated in 2017 to digitize all North American dragonfly and damselfly species (some 464 species). We are working to produce a rich, informative dataset of high-resolution imagery of these species (including multiple males and females from each), partnering with several odonate collections, and building the most complete dataset of odonate wings ever compiled.

The TOWD dataset will be used for two main purposes:
1. as training data to expand the capabilities of [Odomatic](https://www.crossveins.com/research) - an automatic species identification system for dragonflies and damselflies, and
2. to answer questions about the flight strategies, mating behavior and other aspects of odonate evolutionary biology.

The dataset will also be made available to the public on [OdonataCentral](https://www.odonatacentral.org/) via the [CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org/) cyberinfrastructure, allowing other researchers to use it as well.

## People

**Jessica L. Ware**, PI
Jessica heads the [Insect Systematics Lab](https://www.jessicalwarelab.com/) at Rutgers University-Newark, where she and her students explore the evolutionary history of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) as well as Dictyoptera (cockroaches, termites, and mantises). She leads the TOWD digitization and research efforts at Rutgers.

**John C. Abbott**, co-PI
John is the Director of Museum Research & Collections at the Alabama Museum of Natural History in Tuscaloosa ([more about him](https://almnh.ua.edu/abbott.html)). John leads the TOWD digitization efforts at ALMNH.

**William R. Kuhn**, senior personnel
Will is a graduate of Jessica's Lab at Rutgers and is now an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. The TOWD project is an extension of his dissertation work, in which he digitized a small set of Odonata and developed Odomatic. He manages the data workflow for TOWD.
