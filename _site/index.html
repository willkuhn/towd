      <h2 id="about-the-project">About the Project</h2>

<p><strong>Dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata)</strong> are highly skilled aerial acrobats, due largely to the intricacies of their most prominent features: their <strong>wings</strong>. These structures are both functional and beautiful: they provide extreme maneuverability and durability in a lightweight package, and they can be marked with bright color patterns and even iridescence! The structure and appearance of these wings provides a <strong>rich source of information</strong> about the evolutionary history, aerodynamic constraints, and behavior of a species.</p>

<p>The Targeted Odonata Wing Digitization (TOWD) Project is part of an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1564386&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">NSF-funded</a>, multi-institutional effort to develop ODOMATIC, software for automatically identifying Odonata from images. Initiated in 2016, the TOWD Project aims to digitize the world’s dragonfly and damselfly species, starting with the approx. <strong>466 North American species</strong>. We are working to produce a <strong>high-resolution imagery</strong> of these species (including multiple males and females from each), partnering with several odonate collections, and building the most complete dataset of odonate wings ever compiled. Behind the scenes, we use <strong>computer vision</strong> to pull phenotypic information from our wings, which can be used for identification and comparative study.</p>

<p>The TOWD dataset will be used for <strong>two main purposes</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>as training data to <strong>expand the capabilities of <a href="https://www.crossveins.com/research">ODOMATIC</a></strong> - an automatic species recognition system for dragonflies and damselflies, and</li>
  <li>to <strong>answer questions</strong> about the flight strategies, mating behavior and other aspects of odonate evolutionary biology.</li>
</ol>

<p>The TOWD Project’s imagery dataset will be made available to the public on <a href="https://www.odonatacentral.org/">OdonataCentral</a> via the <a href="http://www.cyverse.org/">CyVerse</a> cyberinfrastructure, once the project is complete. Until then, you can <a href="#project-progress"><strong>view our progress</strong></a> below.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-digitization-work">How does digitization work?</h3>

<p>We designed an inexpensive digitization setup that uses a commercially-available desktop scanner (connected to a computer) and custom-build paper ‘frame’ placed on the scanner glass to hold things in place and standardize our images. The image below is an example of the final product: one pair of wings is excised and scanned separately from the rest of the body, which is also scanned along with labels and a color standard and scale. Each item gets it’s own ‘window’ in the frame and everything is imaged at once in one high-resolution scan.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="what-do-we-do-with-the-scans">What do we do with the scans?</h3>

<p>Specimen scans are uploaded to our dataset on <a href="https://bisque.cyverse.org">Cyverse’s BisQue</a> - a powerful imaging platform that allows us to view them from a web browser or work with them from the backend via scripts using BisQue’s API. It’s at this point that one of the most exciting parts of the project takes place behind the scenes, governed by <a href="#project-on-github">scripts</a>. Our specimen inventory is updated periodically by a script that reads barcodes and labels from the latest scans and checks them against collection databases to get species names and locality information associated with them. Another script detects the wings in each image and automatically measures morphometric properties of each wing (area, length, width, etc.), and also calculates information about its appearance and texture. We can these use these data to make comparisons among species or to update our ODOMATIC species recognition model, using machine learning.</p>

<h2 id="project-progress">Project progress</h2>

<p>Our goal is to image at least 10 males and 10 females from each of the 466 dragonfly and damselfly species in Canada and the US. The progress of this ambitious endeavor (as of 17 August 2018) is illustrated in two forms below.</p>
