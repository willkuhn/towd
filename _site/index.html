<h3 id="about-the-project">About the Project</h3>

<p>Dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) are highly skilled aerial acrobats, due largely to the intricacies of their most prominent features: their wings. These structures are both functional and beautiful: they provide extreme maneuverability and durability in a lightweight package, and they can be marked with bright color patterns and even iridescence!</p>

<p>The TOWD Project is part of an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1564386&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">NSF-funded</a>, multi-institutional effort to develop ODOMATIC, software for automatically identifying Odonata from images. Initiated in 2016, the TOWD Project aims to digitize all North American dragonfly and damselfly species (some 464 species). We are working to produce a high-resolution imagery of these species (including multiple males and females from each), partnering with several odonate collections, and building the most complete dataset of odonate wings ever compiled.</p>

<p>The TOWD dataset will be used for two main purposes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>as training data to expand the capabilities of <a href="https://www.crossveins.com/research">Odomatic</a> - an automatic species identification system for dragonflies and damselflies, and</li>
  <li>to answer questions about the flight strategies, mating behavior and other aspects of odonate evolutionary biology.</li>
</ol>

<p>The TOWD Project’s imagery dataset will be made available to the public on <a href="https://www.odonatacentral.org/">OdonataCentral</a> via the <a href="http://www.cyverse.org/">CyVerse</a> cyberinfrastructure, once the project is complete. Until then, you can view a snapshot of our progress below.</p>

<h3 id="meet-our-team">Meet Our Team</h3>

<p><strong>Dr. Jessica L. Ware</strong>, PI (<a href="https://www.jessicalwarelab.com/">website</a>)
Jessica is an Associate Professor at Rutgers University-Newark and heads the Insect Systematics (IS) Lab there, where she and her students explore the evolutionary history of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) as well as Dictyoptera (cockroaches, termites, and mantises). She leads the TOWD digitization and research efforts at Rutgers.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. John C. Abbott</strong>, co-PI (<a href="https://almnh.ua.edu/abbott.html">website</a>)
John is an odonatologist and the Director of Museum Research &amp; Collections at the Alabama Museum of Natural History in Tuscaloosa. He leads the TOWD digitization efforts at ALMNH.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Gareth Russell</strong>, co-PI (<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/njit.edu/russell-lab/">website</a>)
Gareth is an Associate Professor at NJIT and plays an advisory role in the TOWD Project.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. William R. Kuhn</strong>, senior personnel (<a href="https://crossveins.com">website</a>)
Will is a graduate of the IS Lab and is now an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. The TOWD project is an extension of his dissertation work, in which he digitized a small set of Odonata and developed ODOMATIC. He manages the data workflow for TOWD, as well as this website.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Melissa Sanchez Herrera</strong>, postdoc (<a href="https://www.polythore.com/">website</a>)
Also a graduate of the IS Lab, Melissa worked as a postdoc under the TOWD Project in 2017. There she helped get the Project up and running – developing our digitization protocol, beginning our effort to scan Odonata from several collections with a team of undergraduate students, and much more! She continues to collaborate with us from her new/old home in Bogotá, Colombia.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Dirk Gassmann</strong>, postdoc (<a href="https://www.jessicalwarelab.com/postdoctoral">website</a>)
Dirk is our current TOWD postdoc at the IS Lab. He manages a team of undergraduate students at Rutgers, continuing our scanning effort there. Dirk is also developing additional odonate datasets, seeking to answer questions about flight strategies among dragonflies.</p>

<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>

<p>Our goal is to image at least 10 males and 10 females from each of the 464 North American dragonfly and damselfly species. The progress of this endeavor is illustrated below: black boxes are North American species, clusters of boxes are genera, and rows are families. The number of scans that we’ve made out of 10 for males (red) and females (blue) are shown as progress bars for each species.</p>
